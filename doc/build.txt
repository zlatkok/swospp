Description of build process, necessary tools, directory hierarchy,
what goes where...

Programs needed for full recompilation:
- GNU make
- subset of any working Unix environment (for shell, and some UNIX utilities)
- Open Watcom C Compiler (main program used to be compiled with it, but
  nowadays used for test programs only)
- GCC 4.9.x (4.8.x might not work)
- NASM 0.98.36 my patched version (because they broke some macros... see if we
  can fix this) (in /extra)
- Perl (any not-totally-ancient version will do), with Switch module
- Python, same note
- alink, my modified version (in /extra)
- go32, my util [OBSOLETE - not needed with new Perl build script]
- winzip, for dist package packing [not used atm, see if we can use it again or
  remove it]


bin    - binary files, SWOS++, loader, utility programs...
dist   - this is where the dist archive will be created
doc    - various documentation, both internal and published
etc    - various files that don't belong anywhere else, listings, lib files,
         etc.
extra  - additional scripts and executables needed for build
loader - loader source
main   - SWOS++ source
mapcvt - map file and source of converter from map file to .asm/.inc/.h
obj    - object files, as well as executables
other  - other sources not belonging to the project
patch  - patcher source
pe2bin - source of converter from Win32 PE to custom executable format
test   - unit tests for various components, and misc test code


Environment

Few environment variables need to be set to build and use utility scripts:
SWOS        - contains path where SWOS is installed
SWOSPP      - contains path to SWOS++ dev root dir
SWOS_DIRS   - additional SWOS directories for testing (separated with
              semicolon)

Assuming everything is set up properly, binary can be built by running:
make rel (for release version)
and
make dbg (for debug version)

If everything went well, swospp.bin and other required binaries will be placed
into bin directory.


Includes

New Perl script will automagically determine dependencies, so no need to set
them explicitely anymore.
Each include has to include #pragma once line.


Defines

DEBUG - defined in debug version, undefined in release
TEST  - creating testing build (to be implemented)


Perl Makefile

TODO


mapcvt, detaljni opis, kako se dodaju simboli

Describe, TODO :)


bin file construction process

TODO - translate & expand
Najpre se kompajliraju i asembluju osnovni fajlovi projekta. Dobija se win32 pe
executable, pomalo specifican, sa odredjenim potrebnim sekcijama i
eksportovanim simbolima. Zatim se to salje konvertoru koji konvertuje exe u
binarni fajl koji SWOS++ loader moze da ucita i startuje.
Iz map fajla se kreira master include fajl koji koriste gotovo svi asm fajlovi.
