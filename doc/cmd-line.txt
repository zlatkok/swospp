Original SWOS command line switches:

/h - use EGA graphics mode (actually disabled by SWOS++)
/f - don't use EGA graphics mode
/n - allocate less memory (4mb version I believe)

Command line parsing is at cseg:1adbf


SWOS++ additional command line switches:

/s<game name> - go directly to multiplayer lobby, and host a game called
                <game name>
/c<game name> - search for a game name <game name>, and if found try to connect
                to it automatically
/t<number>    - set timeout for game search (/c paremeter), it is given in
                seconds, range is 5 to 60 seconds, if ommited default timeout
                of 30 seconds will be used
/i<file name> - name of info file that will be used by SWOS++ to write various
                events and informations and about the game
/p<nickname>  - set player nickname to what is given; it is only used for
                current session and does not interfere with normal options; if
                ommited saved nickname from multiplayer options will be used

Parameters follow directly after switches, no spaces, If a string parameter
contains spaces, place it in quotes.
If /s or /c with game name was given game will try to go directly into
multiplayer lobby as server or client.
