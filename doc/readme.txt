                                      SWOS++
                                      ======

=== Installation and uninstallation

To use SWOS++ you must have PC version of Sensible World Of Soccer 96/97
correctly installed with all supporting files. It is recommended that you make
a backup of SWOS executable before doing anything listed below.

To install SWOS++, you must do the following:

1) copy files:
    - patchit.com
    - loader.bin
    - swospp.bin

to directory where SWOS is installed.

2) run patchit.com, and select '1' (install) from menu - if everything went
allright, you should get a reply: "Patched OK."

Now SWOS++ is installed and ready to use.

To uninstall it, first run patchit, and select '2' (uninstall) from menu. You
should get same reply "Patched OK.". Then delete files:
    - patchit.com
    - loader.bin
    - swospp.bin


=== System requirements

SWOS++ requires SWOS to work, so any computer capable of running SWOS will host
it quite happily. It requires some small amount of additional memory (currently
about 300kb) to load. Network play requires DOSBox, without it it might work
only in local IPX network, but that has never been tested.


=== Additional considerations

If you are using any versions of key patch, you will have to remove it because
of incompatibilities between it and SWOS++. First remove keypatch, and then
install SWOS++. Do not worry about support for two players on keyboard, it has
been added to SWOS++. Just go to controls menu and select controls that you
like.
