01.01.2017.
- all bugs should be fixed, preparing the release
- GAH! just found out that the watchers were broken ever since port to GCC :(
  it was caused by parentheses added stupidly to wrong place when sign
  extending coordinates from 10 bits to full int... Parentheses ARE evil!
31.12.2016.
- implemented joystick reading via BIOS, it made wonders in DOSBox, as it just
  gets the value directly instead of polling game port in loop; still a bit
  buggy but getting there
19.12.2016.
- broke 5000 fixups limit... raising to 6000
18.12.2016.
- refactored variable names to use `m_' prefix if internal to module, `g_` if
  global (still converting those, only heavily used for now)
11.12.2016.
- 1.9.2.0 sent to Playa; did some fixed for "coach" bug blindly, but can't
  reproduce, so just hoping for the best
- bunch of small bugs fixed that were there for a long time
06.12.2016.
- added saving of player positions in play match menu, as well as current
  tactics; that damn bug when "play match" changes to "coach match" still
  eludes me
- changed file ordering to alphabetically, order by modification time was too
  annoying when trying to fix multiple errors in one file with rebuilding in
  between
03.12.2016.
- I fixed that damn and so annoying bug where swapping players in starting
  lineup wouldn't work after first game... seems that I was adding selected
  teams to selected teams buffer without resetting number of teams first...
  that caused SWOS' elaborate caching system to pick up first team (which is
  now obsolete), and return it when looking for players... in turn causing
  player positions table not to get updated when players are swapped (or more
  accurately it gets updated, but in wrong team).... ugh, so finally found it
  after looking at ALL the wrong places...
22.11.2016.
- fixed bug which was causing matches to last too short - it was actually one
  wrong constant in UpdateTime, that was probably left over from Amiga where
  frame rate is different
14.11.2016.
- SWOS 2016/2017 anniversary edition is out!
11.11.2016.
- preparing new version, for 20th SWOS anniversary
01.05.2016.
- v1.9.1.7 sent to Playaveli
- fixed options not being saved to disk (skip frames and network timeout weren't
  updated inside MP options, and standard SWOS options got overwritten with
  default ones since FinishMultiplayer called RestoreOptions on exit even if we
  weren't in multiplayer menu - boolean was introduced to prevent this from
  happening, there might be a race condition but this is just a quick fix to
  make SWOS++ more playable during wait for win32 port ;))
- removed some unused variables from main.asm
- renamed etc/ dir to var/
- removed Switch module dependency from Makefile.pl
22.09.2015.
- v1.9.1.6 released, possibly last version, as the work on win32 SWOS is in
  progress; fixed TONS of stuff since last entry
13.07.2015.
- WriteToLog parameters finally enclosed in only one parentheses pair :)
27.06.2015.
- development is going fine, lot of bugs have been fixed and it feels like I
  might be back on track; the reason I was writing this entry was to note that
  GCC is treating bool as single byte value, while Watcom was treating it as
  full double word - this is what asm code was expecting and it already caused
  few weird and hard to track bugs
22.06.2015.
- some small bugs fixed, artifacts of porting are still showing up; today was
  forced to merge .rdata into .data despite having support for it in pe2bin -
  it seems executable was built in such a way that beginning of an array in bss
  section was before the end of data (despite alignment, probably to use space
  more efficiently); however I have no idea how to detect this, and correctly
  offset fixup to point to bss (since reference is within raw size of .data
  section)
  edit: lowering file-align in alink fixed that problem even without merging,
  but both lowering alignment and merging .rdata lowered executable size, so I'm
  using both now ;)
  edit 2: just discovered that I did some testing with -Os and forgot it on; the
  whole deal was probably some size optimization... right now on -O3 it leaves
  plenty of space between last data and first bss byte
29.05.2015.
- wrote IPX server in Python to be used in stress testing the network (still
  gotta implement packet loss, lag inducing and packet reordering)
24.05.2015.
- there are still some bugs, but porting to GCC is almost done!
15.05.2015.
- lots of fixes during the porting; especially to pe2bin and alink, and even
  bindmp
02.05.2014.
- porting the source to GCC is under-way
- fixed Perl makefile to include it's own timestamp in rebuild calculation - now
  everything rebuilds if script is changed (as it should)
11.11.2014.
- was well on my way implementing SWOS calls through dll import table, but
  after giving it some more thought decided against it; if implemented that
  way, each API would need to have 4 bytes set aside to hold function address,
  and indirect call would take 6 bytes, so 10 bytes in total per call; current
  calla implementation only requires 7; we don't really need separate table for
  those function addresses, since they're actually known before hand - it's
  enough to reference the symbol; entire problem stems from a fact that it's
  hard to instruct compiler to call functions in a specific way - normally
  they're just relative calls, or go through a pointer; we actually need
  absolute call to be generated (like calla does)
- thought I could change calla macro in asm to generate absolute call from
  memory location, but Intel never made instruction to do that.. we can only
  call indirect or far absolute.. no near absolute
- and fixed a little buffer overflow when we receive game name from network...
  oopsie!
10.11.2014.
- caught a mistake renaming 68k registers in two places.. yikes! so double
  checked everything again, it looks good now
07.11.2014.
- finally switched to real 68k register names... finally!
06.11.2014.
- changed bitmap drawing function from asm to C but forgot to set which
  register gets which param... wooops, and found out just now; seemingly small
  changes can have potent effect, one can never be too careful
05.11.2014.
- found out iswhat macros were vulnerable (isspace, isdigit...), they weren't
  normalizing input index before accessing the table, they were assuming it was
  a char; this caused infinite loop in xml parser when last character was
  whitespace following non-whitespace - ouch...
30.10.2014.
- xml parser finally passed tests... note to self: never make your own xml(ish)
  parser again, not even primitive and simplified as this one
16.10.2014.
- xml lexer passed tests
01.10.2014.
- buffered file tests passed, now the log will go through it, increasing
  performances in debug version and hopefully making it usable for game play
29.09.2014.
- did a funny thing today - wrote a simple DOS file access to WinAPI layer to
  do a test of buffered files: it worked by replacing each file-related int 21h
  call with invalid opcode (ud2), then installing exception handler which would
  inspect registers, re-route everything through WinAPI, sort returned data
  back to registers, and continue execution right after invalid bytes; it
  actually worked surprisingly well!
15.09.2014.
- big fuss with test build symbols - in util.c we had some functions such as
  memmove which were only wrappers for SWOS' memmove (swos_libc_memmove_), and
  in mock file I was trying to reroute it to Watcom's memmove, but the linker
  was discovering symbol in util.c and linked to it - resulting in lovely stack
  overflow due to infinite recursion :P; managed to fix it by explicitly
  listing object files from lib files _BEFORE_ user obj files
14.09.2014.
- source ported to OpenWatcom - he's complaining more than his daddy and has
  already caught some errors that have been sanitized; now SWOS++ might compile
  on modern Windows, I'll see if I can switch to it at next opportunity
01.09.2014.
- another merry buggie solved: I've noticed that bss section wasn't working in
  some cases, the exe file bloated after adding stack buffer to main.asm; after
  some testing it was determined that in C files bss was working, but not in
  asm.. that led me to believe the bug was in alink, and related to coff;
  however everything was fine, the problem lied in section merging order -
  command for merging .bss into .data was added to the beginning of the linked
  list, and later we had more merging into .data (ie. .strdata to .data) which
  had real data in them and canceled bss property... C files were placing
  variables to _BSS which got merged later and that's why they worked; so now
  alink defers automatic .bss to .data conversion until user given merges have
  been completed (unless user explicitly lists .bss to .data, then we respect
  user given order)
31.08.2014.
- switched to our own 64kb stack, by simply copying stack to static buffer and
  setting esp :) (best I could come up with in the end :P); it works
  surprisingly well, now at least there's some breathing space, and I can
  increase it compile-time if needed
30.08.2014.
- GNU make strangled in a shallow pond - Perl build script written (took about a
  week); build environment is now far better - I can move files to
  subdirectories as I see fit without updating paths and dependencies -
  everything is done automagically :)
  + it works way faster, I didn't even expect that but accepting it both
  handedly :)
- fixed a bug in alink, alto I'm not sure how well - there was a problem moving
  entry point if it was located inside a section that's getting merged (it
  didn't manifest before because main.obj used to be first in the link list
  of files that contain .text section, so all others were merged into main's obj
  file); once the rewrite is done make sure it's fixed properly
23.08.2014.
- callCdecl macro introduced to invoke cdecl functions correctly and modified
  WriteToLog to use it
- test cases introduced, only for crash logger and qAlloc at the moment
- crash handler finished, and working very nicely ;)
17.08.2014.
- devilish custom tactics finally passed tests
- all headers switched to #pragma once
16.08.2014.
- it took a while, but I finally fixed crippled DOSBox debugger! now I can view
  variable contents, and use them in expressions, as well as set breakpoint
  directly to function; debugging is way more comfortable now
27.07.2014.
- beautiful syntax highlighting for UltraEdit defined
- finally changed TRUE to true :P
13.07.2014.
- added object file name from which the symbol originated to map file - now it's
  much easier to map address back to symbol during debugging
09.07.2014.
- great lack of functionality discovered - tactics couldn't be edited for teams
  containing players with numbers greater than 16, and no one noticed it for all
  this time; took a while to implement it too
07.07.2014.
- bug found - high player numbers aren't working in edit tactics menu; one part
  is fixed, but more remains
03.06.2014.
- I found that little zero in player numbers wasn't clipped well... lost lot of
  time on it, but it's now benT!
- just seen (and fixed) improper sending of negative coordinates, sign got lost
  in casting
01.06.2014.
- wasn't updating this log much, but development is moving slowly... just had
  another case of patching the patch :P added hook to flip but overwritten old
  one that was checking keys for replays... and also killed output of dump
  variables
21.04.2014.
- cleansed this log file
20.04.2014.
- parsemap.pl improved, now symbols for C header can be defined using simple
  syntax
17.04.2014.
- ugh finally fixed that diabolic bug - desync during second game in a row; it
  was in fact variable frameCount which I SAW in memory diff dumps, but I
  THOUGHT IT BELONGED TO MENUS (AAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH)... get me a hammer to batter
  my head... so I went further and used DOSBox logcpu command to log every
  single instruction executed on both clients before the decync; then compared
  log files, starting from OnGameLoopEnd(), from currentFrameNo increment -
  chopped everything before that - and fed the result to a Perl script which had
  defined memory ranges used to discard instructions - in order to remove
  interrupts that were randomly popping in, as well as irrelevant code which
  truly is (and should be) different on both clients.. so, day or two of
  debugging went by, but I'm very satisfied to have solved it in the end :P
15.04.2014.
- in-game Sprite structure added, and old Sprite renamed to SpriteGraphics
12.04.2014.
- there, after lot of effort I finally have a version that can be called usable
  (I hope!); sent it to Davor, let's see how this will turn out
  contacted Playaveli too but he didn't respond yet
01.04.2014.
- funny bug fixed accidentally, while looking for something else - value for
  function offset was + 48 where 48 was supposed to be hexadecimal, but somehow
  ended up being decimal; stuff like this is hell to find...
18.03.2014.
- no idea how this could have worked at all before, but joy2Status wasn't
  initialized and had left-over value from the menus because I had setup of 2
  players on keyboard (and 2nd one masquerades as joypad); that was causing
  desync, I couldn't find what was it for a month (even if I wasn't trying too
  hard)... there is a good side to it, while investigating it I've found and
  fixed bunch of other bugs ;)
09.03.2014.
- don't know why was OpenLogFile() in main.asm instead of debug.c - moved it to
  where it belongs, now the interface is more sane and this also allowed
  removing big-ish #ifdef out of main
31.01.2014.
- finally all of menu cases passed - it was giving me a lot of trouble, with a
  lot of messing on the stack and SWOS internals (cases when client
  automatically moves to next, or goes back to previous menu, not by user
  interaction but externally - by signal from the network)
29.01.2014.
- added dword alignment for menus, data wasn't aligned properly before (and the
  alignment value is 'z' :)); tried online play last weekend against my friend
  Deja but it's not playable, it's too slow, I must add skip frames
08.01.2014.
- created dos.h header and moved DOS-related stuff out of swos.h into it
02.01.2014.
- what a silly SWOS bug, that cost me at least a couple days; ClearBackground
  initializes dx with mov dx, 384 and then does sub dx, ax; but afterwards it
  adds entire edx to edi - that worked only accidentally as it happened that
  SWOS called function with upper part of edx clear; as soon as I called it from
  Watcom it crashed (puked all over the screen to be more precise)
26.12.2013.
- incredible what wrong opcode can cause, instead of eb I typed ee (no idea
  how), so instead of jump some mess was executed (in, out and such) and by some
  wonder some jump came in and _somehow_ continued with approximately correct
  execution... wtf... found it only when I spotted out of place call in log
  file, then placed int 1 and looked for myself what was happening at the
  function exit in the debugger (follow up: seems I inverted bytes)
25.11.2013.
- yesterday I solved synchronization problem; SWOS was using stoppageTimer value
  in various calculations around the engine (as well as currentTick in one place
  when calculating which player takes the ball), and that gets incremented
  inside hardware interrupt handler which is highly machine dependent... not too
  cool for 2 simulations that are supposed to be synchronized, so I moved
  increment code from handler and incremented it in each frame instead; I think
  this might affect game length and maybe some other things, it should be tested
  more thoroughly later, right now at first glance it seems to work well
22.11.2013.
- fixed swos_data_base symbol to have proper value; now Perl is generating it,
  pretty cool how it's possible to do that compile time ;)
23.10.2013.
- today I fixed interesting thing, and I'm not sure how it worked at all before;
  when un-patching is done to remove support for 2nd player on keyboard original
  bytes from IDA are written back... don't we need a fixup there? maybe it
  worked since load address is always the same, who knows, anyway I fixed that
  now [EDIT 25.11.2013.] it's ok if it's call, those bytes are always the same
  (since calls are relative)
13.10.2013.
- unbelievable - checksum wasn't working... in fact it worked, but only for
  first 32 bytes (lol); shifting kicked out informations about first bytes bit
  by bit; replaced it with rotation and it's ok now (no wonder I found that some
  Polish guy "cracked" SWOS++, I thought he patched the checksum routine, but
  instead it was this...)
11.10.2013.
- finally first, big, part is finished, and that is game lobby :)))
  (mi iz veri hepi)
- mplayer.c renamed to mplobby.c
28.09.2013.
- today I learned just how big difference between extern char *x and extern
  char x[] really is - if I put * compiler picks up dword value from there, as
  if it was a variable, and program crashes; if I put [] then everything is
  fine, since it gets treated as an offset
22.09.2013.
- Perl script for finding unused symbols from filter.txt created (simple text
  search), unneeded obsolete symbols removed
21.09.2013.
- fixed a bug in printf - specification wasn't reinitialized between fields, and
  added support for %hhd and %hhx
18.09.2013.
- changed name of create game menu to game lobby menu and updated all references
16.09.2013.
- bug fixed in bindmp: loop went from 16 until >= 0, it needed to be > 0 (it was
  writing 17 bytes per line)
- bug fixed in pe2bin: value wasn't decremented when deciding whether to assign
  fixup to SWOS code or data, so it was wrongly assigned to data instead of code
  for functions close to 0xb0000 (if they're near SWOS virtual size it will
  happen), which of course resulted in crashes (earlier I wasn't using those C
  functions near the top, near data, or .swos section was in different position,
  with higher address)
- I omitted swos_libc_ prefix with 2 new functions and kaboom... killed entire
  Windows as well :P
13.09.2013.
- now WriteToLog preserves flags as well (yes, that happened too)
12.09.2013.
- ok, I think join game is finished (aside from connecting to the game - I'm
  gonna give it a shot now)
- upgraded to UltraEdit 13.10 btw ;)
- fucking nop wasted almost half an hour
11.09.2013.
- gosh what an ugly bug, I was refactoring and somehow left sizeof(IPX_Address)
  instead of member_size(IPX_Address, node) so the program was merrily
  overwriting socket and source network address... no wonder it kept failing to
  send reply
- I'm changing system of access to C functions inside SWOS, they will now have
  prefix swos_libc_, and util.c will have C prototype that calls SWOS function
  indirectly through pointer; this way they shouldn't accidentally be called
  directly
10.09.2013.
- log file now has time-stamp on each line
- after investigating frequent crashes due to stack overflow I've discovered
  that stack memory is very limited (3.7kb at startup); moved lot of buffers
  from stack to bss
- I'm amazed how fast build works now
- wow I found bug in memset... who knows what I was thinking when I was writing
  that, just gonna use the one from SWOS
09.09.2013.
- no wonder file was smaller, bastard wasn't linking half of stuff...
  binary file is now per-fect!
- only thing swospp.bin has increased by 3kb, must be due to some alignment, off
  to see about that...
- work on alink is finally done, and it WORKKKKSSSSSSS!!! millennium bug is
  solved and MS link kicked out! FUCK YOU MS LINK! GTFO!
06.09.2013.
- haha old UltraEdit by default doesn't use Unix style regular expressions -
  those have to be turned on, but I thought it was buggy and installed new
  version
- due to unstoppable avalanche of progress, even if nobody believed it was
  possible anymore, miraculous menu macro system got further enhanced by
  advanced state-of-the-art macros equipped by functionality for defining
  symbols having menu item ordinals as values
05.09.2013.
- I finally solved why it wouldn't receive a packet, problem was in FP_SEG and
  FP_OFF macros, they simply didn't perform translation in a way I needed
  (perhaps they would work if I allocated memory via that other interrupt?), and
  of course that was fucking last place I looked at, after trying out shit load
  of other things...
- fixed bug in vsprintf, it wasn't working properly for %c (surprisingly library
  function had that bug - more likely my adaptation of it)
- logo bitmap kicked out of source directory + make rule made; I don't want it
  polluting the source tree when I wanna check the size :P
03.09.2013.
- fixed part of code and documentation pertaining to menus (kinda surprising,
  since it's otherwise very well explored), it was in connection to rarely used
  "skipping" of items feature (when the item user tries to go to is disabled or
  invisible, decision is made which item to go to instead)
31.08.2013.
- amazing bug fixed; ordinary lack of attention and memory overwrite, but the
  things I tried in those few hours... at least I set up shaky DOSBox debugger
  :)
29.08.2013.
- seems I've solved one of mysteries that have been tormenting me; sometimes the
  assembler+linker combination seemed to generate invalid call; call xxxxx
  instruction would jump god-knows-where and program would crash; I remember how
  frustrating that was; but today I was surprisingly calm and in a bit over half
  day found a reason :) not exact, but at least approximate :P - problem was in
  having code in data section; I don't know exactly what went wrong but most
  likely the alignment got messed up + sections get merged so who knows what
  becomes of it in the end; once the code goes to .text section (as it should)
  everything works out just fine
  and it seem I've predicted string menu entries. Kudos. To me.
07.01.2005.
- GoalScored disintegrated!
- ShowResult disintegrated!
  I have all the sprite names except for one which seems to be dead variable;
  gonna fill in now what I couldn't before about the sprites
- game_state 22 figured out
06.01.2005.
- continued work from yesterday... those penalty variables really pulled things
  through... figured out field 40 in ingame team structure - it's number of own
  goals
05.01.2005.
- after quite a while, finally some sort of progress; game_state almost entirely
  figured out; figured out lot of variables related to penalties after the game,
  and some more stuff... in the prime of Clan Lord, waiting for the Dutchman...
19.07.2004.
- version 1.4 published
- Watcom/M$ link combination is making _horrible_ problems; after certain
  combination of static and non-static variables/functions, compiler (and/or
  linker) freaks out - it accesses variables with random offsets, jumps into
  random parts of code...
15.07.2004.
- area of bug definitely narrowed to bench - each corrupted recording crashes
  after bench is shown
- problem was in a function that gets called when returning from bench to game;
  this function deletes contents of current hil buffer, and resets pointer to
  the beginning; bug happens in the following situation:
  - contents of the buffer are saved, last and one before last dword are camera
    coordinates and goals, pointer was reset to the beginning and flags were
    written there
  - buffer continues to fill up, let's say until half full
  - bench is called, and there we stay until say 3/4 of the buffer
  - bench is left, buffer is emptied, pointer is reset and unsaved flags get
    deleted (ouch)
  - writing to buffer is resumed, starting with camera, goals, flags...
  - so we get situation that happens in corrupted .rpl files:
    camera, goals, [flags are missing!!!], camera, goals, flags...
- thinking about how to solve the problem: perhaps best thing to do is to wait
  until camera goes to the bench, save one frame, turn off recording until
  camera starts going back to the field; currently it's set up to record
  everything
14.07.2004.
- load addresses of SWOS and SWOS++ logged at startup so we can find exact
  instruction in case of crash
- investigated replay saving - it's possible that bug is showing up if some
  function is changing goal_base_ptr (which is used for saving) and sets it
  slightly in front of base buffer
- returned listing creating for .asm files - it's only a notch slower
- bug is not because of goal_base_ptr - it remains constant
08.07.2004.
- fixed rounding to 4 code inside pe2bin, x += 4 - x % 4 is not good, in case of
  x divisible by 4 (d-oooh)
18.06.2004.
- very important things are hidden inside UpdateBall - I believe it could even
  be entire ball physics and its interaction with the pitch depending on weather
  conditions
15.06.2004.
- SWOS2004 preliminary version shipped
02.06.2004.
- and the question of the day remains: Where's The Walrus?
01.06.2004.
- big event, discovered (for sure) first AI routine; it handles throw-ins, but
  it could be more general
30.05.2004.
- version check fixed, and it works well, I hope it doesn't have any holes (it
  tests if "real" DOS is less than 6.0, and then displays a warning - int 0x2f
  doesn't work on win2k)
- released SWOS++ 1.3 and SWPE 0.8
22.05.2004.
- size of code section rounded to 4 bytes so the data section would be dword
  aligned
- Windows version check added (but not tested under Windows 2000)
21.05.2004.
- Aminta found a bug: seems when team controls are changed, and game is saved,
  there is some memory overwrite inside the team which causes SWOS to crash when
  that team later plays a game
- bug was found and fixed: problem was that when saving diy SWOS function is
  called that contains call to CommonMenuExit - it expects to be called in
  context of main menu; so it happily takes pointer to tenth entry (which is
  title), forms competition name and writes it to the pointer; since my menu is
  active and the entry in question points to name of the team, that name will be
  overwritten, as well as some important data that follows it; seems when I
  tested I wasn't using long names so everything worked fine (and I wasn't
  paying attention to the team name); fixed it by moving top PrepareMenu call
  below if
- configured cp in make store to preserve original file dates
- turned off listing creating during assembly - will test to see if it's working
  any faster now
20.05.2004.
- diy menu modified to work same as load menu
19.05.2004.
- ta da!!! finished f*cking duy edit menu and it works!!! it's 12:10 am; gonna
  send this to Aminta, and let him deal with it (will publish later)
17.05.2004.
- choose team menus have wrong names (too narrow); figured out one of greatest
  secrets about choose team menus; also figured out dynamic menu item resizing
  (easy peasy)
16.05.2004.
- managed to remove vsprintf from release: remembered that I could use SWOS'
  PrimitivePrintf - primitive but enough for my current needs
- it's past 12... sooo tired and getting up early tomorrow... need to find exact
  location of menu that displays selected teams in diy competition and does
  dynamic adjustment of entry size based on number of teams (and snatch that
  code, bwahahaha...)
15.05.2004.
- work on the menu is underway
- unfortunately, I had to bring vsprintf.c back to release version (because of
  sprintf which is currently only used in one place - maybe remove that later),
  and the binary file bloated...

- begun working on new version - started with inserting new menu entry
03.05.2004.
- version 1.2.3 released with _completely_ fixed bugs regarding display of
  player numbers greater than 16
- I just noticed that SWOS++ blocks normal functioning of highlights: only first
  highlight gets saved to file
02.05.2004.
- I just found out that SWOS++ isn't compatible with EGA graphics - once the
  game starts all there is on the screen are some blotches dancing around, and
  after a while it crashes
- EGA graphics murdered entirely
- fixed player numbers while they're getting booked
- EGA graphics turned off in debug mode only (seems it's in conflict with debug
  system)
27.04.2004.
- lot of stuff done
26.04.2004.
- great success, large amount of data obtained, and lot of mistakes in the
  documentation fixed
- added new type for dump: 'p' = pointer, just write its value as dword
25.04.2004.
- size of release swospp.bin chopped down by a kilobyte - PrintString() and
  associated stuff went under #ifdef DEBUG
- lot of interesting things found using dump-var debug system (long live)
- confirmed that x, y and z coordinates of sprites begin at +30 (and not at +32
  as it was written in the docs earlier)
- version 1.2.2 published, took down versions 1.2.1 and 1.2 from the download
  page so people wouldn't download them (they're buggy)
23.04.2004.
- fixed bench player numbers (disabled the procedure that sets them)
22.04.2004.
- released new version, 1.2.1, and fixed link page to open links in new window
  instead of frame
- beginnings of sections in swospp.bin are now aligned to 4 bytes
21.04.2004.
- fixed bug in substitutes menu when garbage was showing up instead of player
  numbers greater than 16; menu was extended a bit and names and positions moved
  so everything could fit nicely
20.04.2004.
- dependencies in make files fixed - I was listing include files as dependencies
  of c and .asm files (instead they should be .obj files dependencies) - d-oh!
  (thanks Dule)
17.04.2004.
- all this packed up and new version 1.2 released
- rar archives removed from the site
- winzip reinstated as default packer, because of long file names (and case)
- added third executable name to patcher, for underdogs SWOS; size mismatch is
  not fatal error anymore but only a warning so the entire thing can work with
  Aminta's patched version of SWOS
- player numbers finished - centering implemented and added special treatment
  for the case when two ones go one after another, in this case we tuck them
  closer together by one pixel - it looks much nicer
15.04.2004.
- aaand fixed... at least it should be, I played entire game and watched replay
  without problems, only thing I saw was messed up S sprite over the referee
  while he was booking a player
- so, at 20:46 I'm writing a fix; it was negative value of y (-1) that was
  causing the problems all this time
- isolated random crash bug with drawing player numbers higher than 16: when
  drawing small zero, in VerLine, exactly at the place of memory access
  (near the mov [esi], al instruction)
- started this log file
