- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  start playing the game, exit client via alt-F1, but make sure server isn't restarted
  restart client, recreate game on server and try to play again - there should be no desync
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  exit client via alt-F1, and quickly press start game on server - there should be no crash/assert
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  join with client, then exit via alt-F1, start SWOS again quickly and rejoin - should rejoin without problems
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,

Misc.:
- drawing of player numbers >16 during the game
-           -||-                during edit tactics menu
- test YU letters (open about menu)

Memory leaks:
- each time SWOS is closed look in log file and verify there was no memory leaks
  (also verify that memory leaks checker was invoked at all ;)
  expected text: qAlloc OK. No memory leaks.
- exceptions:
    - on client side in direct mode, when server disbands the game, player left packet will not be cleaned up


Of course, playing few games without crashing would be great :)
