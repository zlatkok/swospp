Basic:
- create multiplayer game
- join multiplayer game
- join multiplayer game when multiple games are discovered, verify that joined game is the one actually selected
- verify that number of players in listed games is correct
- press play match on 1st player, but go back to lobby with 2nd player, then press start game again, verify that controls don't lock up
- change team while in game lobby, and verify that team in game is actually chosen team
- start multiplayer game
- change multiplayer nickname and game name, verify that they get saved after game restart
  (as well as in multiplayer options)
- change standard SWOS options, restart SWOS and verify that options get saved (especially skip frames and network timeout)
- create multiplayer game and change MP options in lobby, restart SWOS and verify that options get saved
- verify that changing multiplayer options doesn't affect normal options
- change tactics in multiplayer options menu, make a custom tactics and save, verify that there are no errors and that they get saved properly
- with fresh install, verify that default multiplayer game name and player nickname are created
- create direct connect game, and join from a client
- exit game via escape, verify it is working properly on both server and the client
- take a note of pitch type set by the host, and verify that it is honoured in more than one game
- go to controls, select at least one joypad, calibrate, try with and without cancelling 2nd button, verify that everything works correctly

Sync/network:
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  start playing the game, exit client via alt-F1, but make sure server isn't restarted
  restart client, recreate game on server and try to play again - there should be no desync
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  exit client via alt-F1, and quickly press start game on server - there should be no crash/assert
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  join with client, then exit via alt-F1, start SWOS again quickly and rejoin - should rejoin without problems
- set up 2 DOSBox'es, 1st as server, 2nd as client,
  after clicking start game on server quickly click and hold client's DOSBox title bar causing connecting...
  dialog to show up - it should show up properly and disappear after title bar is released or timeout expired
  (additionally, message that the player left should be shown)
- when more than one game is found in multiplayer join game menu, verify that a correct game is joined in each case

Misc.:
- drawing of player numbers >16 during the game
-           -||-                during edit tactics menu
- test YU letters (open about menu)
- test menus when starting the game: game is started when both players are ready and server hits start game button;
  client may happen to have opened other menus than game lobby: choose teams, or continue/abort prompt; verify that
  everything works correctly in that case also (normal game end, as well as error)

Memory leaks:
- each time SWOS is closed look in log file and verify there was no memory leaks
  (also verify that memory leaks checker was invoked at all ;)
  expected text: qAlloc OK. No memory leaks.
- exceptions:
    - on client side in direct mode, when server disbands the game, player left packet will not be cleaned up


Of course, playing few games without crashing would be great :)
