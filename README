Hierarchy

bin    - binary files, SWOS++, loader, utility programs...
dist   - this is where the dist archive will be created
doc    - various documentation, both internal and published
etc    - various files that don't belong anywhere else, listings, lib files, etc.
extra  - additional scripts and executables needed for build
loader - loader source
main   - SWOS++ source
mapcvt - map file and source of converter from map file to .asm/.inc/.h
obj    - object files, as well as executables
other  - other sources not belonging to the project
patch  - patcher source
pe2bin - source of converter from Win32 PE to custom executable format
test   - unit tests for various components, and misc test code


Software needed for full recompilation

- GNU make
- subset of any working Unix environment (for shell, and some UNIX utilities)
- Open Watcom C Compiler (main program used to be compiled with it, but
  nowadays used for test programs only)
- GCC 4.9.x (4.8.x might not work)
- NASM 0.98.36 my patched version (in /extra)
- Perl (any not-totally-ancient version will do), with Switch module
- Python, same note
- alink, my modified version (in /extra)


Environment

Few environment variables need to be set to build and use utility scripts:
SWOS        - contains path where SWOS is installed
SWOSPP      - contains path to SWOS++ dev root dir
SWOS_DIRS   - additional SWOS directories for testing (separated with
              semicolon)
